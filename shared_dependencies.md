Based on your prompt, the files we have decided to generate are:

- `app.py`: This file will contain the Flask app code.
- `requirements.txt`: This file will list the required Python libraries and their versions.
- `README.md`: This file will contain instructions on how to use the app.

The shared dependencies between these files are:

- `Flask`: The web framework used to build the app.
- `BeautifulSoup`: The library used for web scraping.
- `Requests`: The library used to make HTTP requests.
- `recipe_scrapers`: The library used to extract recipe information from the URL.
- `FaunaDB`: The database used to store the scraped data.

In addition, the following names will be shared between the app.py file and the HTML templates:

- `form`: The name of the form where users can input the recipe URL.
- `ingredients`: The name of the variable that will store the extracted ingredients.
- `directions`: The name of the variable that will store the extracted directions.

Finally, the following names will be shared between the app.py file and the FaunaDB database:

- `fnAFHYajSvAAUAlA7JjoBFSjGWOWE3_rReAwthfs`: The FaunaDB key used to connect to the database.
- `recipes`: The name of the collection where the scraped data will be stored.
